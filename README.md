# Downgrooves.Mobile
This is a cross-platform Xamarin Forms Mobile app to access my personal music web site data in a mobile device.  The app roughly mirrors the primary web site at downgrooves.com.  The app uses the same .NET Core 5 Web Api (Downgrooves.Core5) as the primary web site and uses mostly the same endpoints to ensure a uniform experience on both the mobile app and the web site.  Although the app is created for both Android and iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, etc.), the app is only available from the Google Play store on Android devices.  The requirement os a $99/year fee for placement on the Apple App Store is not cost effective for this app.

This site and it's companion projects (Downgrooves.Core5, Downgrooves.Angular) are full participants in the Software Development Lifecycle on Azure DevOps.  Through Azure DevOps, the site is configured with automatic build and deployments to a Development and a Production environment.
